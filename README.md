# Scope of the project

The scope of the project is to create a web app for DJ, pretty much my own version of the **DJ BOBOSS** mobile app.
Even though I am far away from Boboss level of ingenuity, this is one of my first projects to test vibe coding.

## Parts of the project

The project is going with the flow, only to see what happens. So I'll try to document a bit of the progression.

### index_onefile

This file is just one HTML file implementing the basic functions of the DJ webapp. It have waveform visualizer, a basic speed and volume controller for 2 decks.
